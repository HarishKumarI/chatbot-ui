Issues from feedback
- P1 => please show me cars between 4 to 8 lakhs ==> API resulted in giving cars from 2.89 Lakh to 6.72
- can you please compare i20 magna with urban cruiser mid grade mt --> showing cruiser mig grade AT also 
- Are there any offers running on the cruiser? ==> gives "Sorry. I am not currently equipped to give information about discounts and offers on cars. I can redirect you to our expert agent who can help. Would you like me to redirect now?"
- what is the engine capacity of i20 magna 105 ==> except engine capacity gave bootspace, fuel tank capacity, no of seating rows, doors, seating capacity
- "what is the dicky space" doesn't work  but "what is its dicky space" works
- Can i20 boot fit 3 large bags? ==> Should be detected as feature quality.
- UI issues reported in the sheet for verions API.
- Show me SUV cars with price greater than 10 lakhs ==> in the inference output detected price and greater than text but not 10 lakh value.
- Show me luxury cars more than 30 lakhs ==> showing results for less than 30 lakhs
- what is the price of audi a6 in cikamagalur ==> exception handling in the handler function.

relations and nodes in graph.


Any one saying in budget should trigger filter.

In general
We need a declarative way of putting in the 'related' information to any template, which will help generate the nudges. 
(Apart from the logic generated nudges for narrowing the long list of possible answers)


Tasks:

1) crashes - done 
2) nudge corrections - need to access and plan
3) compare changes - done
4) filter changes - done
5) graph inclusion of photos - discuss with komal and see 
6) feature explanation - crawled
7) the strength/weakness of model - crawled done add in the graph



From Sheet 

1) My budget is ---> filter intent
2) Filter - Action node - Ask Form (with mandatory variables)
3) Apply context variables 
4) Develop more mappings - seating capacity, etc - DONE

Nudges:
1)  Model summary ->
    card click -> See all versions

    You may also like to :
    2. Photos
    3. Colors
    4. Similar Cars
    5. Strengths and Weaknesses ---> from carwale site
        
2) Above - 
    If multiple models detected, show summary for one and other models are nudges
    else only one model detected, do above

3)  Version Summary ->

    card click -> See other variants   ==> which questions answers this?

    Nudges: 
    Feature Groups
    [Engine] - Engine Details
    [Size] - Dimensions , Capcity
    [Seats, Interiors] - Seats, Storage
    [Entertainment etc]
    [Dashboard]
    [Safety]
    [AC and Conveniences]
4)  For the has_colour carousel we are showing nudges of [version summary].
        Instead let's use

Compare:

1)  Model to Model Compare : Need to show key specs, body type. - DONE
    Price, Engine, Mileage, Transmission.
    will be adding: fuel type, seating capacity, body type, no of colors, no of variants

2)  Version to Version Compare : Show minimal key specs and find features which have got diff value and show some of them at least. 

    Minimal  - price, transmission, fuel type, seating capacity - DONE
     
    Pickup concept instances which have diff value across versions being compared. To accomodate space, . Limit 5

    full-width / thumbnail photo

    use thumbnail photo in version to version compare card

3) The ""link"" for full compaison in version to version case needs to be fully cooked. 

    Ask CarWale - link to compare two models {OR}. put the entry level versions of models in compare URL of carwale" - TODO 

    compare on detected features 

    include the detected features in the key value pair at the top 

    {DETECTED FEATURES}
    {NORMAL}
    {REMOVE DUPLICATE}







Discuss With komal:

1) Price Form Submission
2) Pickup concept instances which have diff value across versions being compared
3) graph inclusion of photos
4) compare on features 
5) Nudges 
6) My budget is ---> filter intent
7) Filter - Action node - Ask Form (with mandatory variables) - later 
8) Apply context variables  




The order of priority should be
1. Crash handling - done 
2. Handling budget related queries through filter intent .. in such a way that the model/version can be picked from context if not available in user query but there in context. - done
3. Filter .. when user query hits filter with no filterable  params detected, 
    we need to show a form of make(text entry), price start/max, body type, seating capacity .. with the make optional.   - later
4. Nudge, card click changes for model card and version card. - 
5. Compare implementation changes for detecting diff when in version/version comparison. Also changes in model compare display.
6. Scrape/graph/blog/sempre/refexp update for photos, feature explanation and strength weakness in that order.





Price Crashing report:
1) after asking ertiga price for lxi version. 
    then for "what is the price for vxi version" returns form with all ertiga versions list 
    for "what is the price for its vxi version" returns form with list of all models with vxi in the version name 
2) Phaltan, Maharashtra, Chikamagalur, Karnataka etc not getting price details from API but are available on site.
